## Environment variables

- `NUMBER_OF_CATS` - total number of cats per fetch, keep this value low for faster fetching and lower bandwidth, recommended at `12`
- `CAT_TAGS` - the cat tag(s), seperated by comma(s), for example `cute,fluffy,orange`. Note that with too much tags, there won't be sufficient (or maybe none) images match your query.
